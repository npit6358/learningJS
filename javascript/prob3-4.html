3. Define and test a function in JavaScript that accepts two arrays and
returns an array that contains only the elements that are common between the
arrays (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two arrays of
different sizes.

//THIS DOESN'T WORK FOR THIS PROBLEM.  IS NOT APPLICABLE, UNFORTUNATELY.
//BASICALLY A UNION OPERATOR FOR LISTS TO COMBINE LIKE SETS.
//maybe just concatenate the arrays into a single working array.  this takes
//care of unequal arrays problem in the simplest fashion (no need to use input
//array lengths and so on).  then sort the array so that we can traverse and
//enter only the first value we encounter that is different than the last.
//thereby skipping duplicates (while next index < final index - 1)
//.  (think we need two indices, cur and next).
//check if cur == next and if not we input it into new array.  (this actually
//inputs the last value of any succesive valus). think cur init is -Infinity.
//This should work for arrays of any element type (provided homogeneity).
